    "We are saddened to announce that this year's event is being cancelled due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The heart and soul of our charity auctions have always been the firefighters that we support. As a precaution, all non-vital events for King County first-responders have been cancelled until further notice. As a result, they will not be able to attend the event. Because of this, and the current situation we have decided to forego our annual event."
