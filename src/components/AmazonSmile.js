      <h2>Help out while you shop!</h2>
      <p>Do you shop on Amazon? If so, there is a way for a portion of all your eligible purchases to be donated to Light My Fire - and there is no additional cost to you! All it takes is a minute to set up your amazon account.    </p>
      <h3>Giving with Amazon Smile</h3>
      <p>Amazon Smile is a charity program set up by Amazon where a small percentage of your purchases will be donated to a charity of your choice. </p>
      <p>How to get Started</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Follow this link to choose your Amazon Smile Charity</li>
        <li>Shop at smile.amazon.com. Amazon only donates if you make the purchases on the smile sub-domain - so don't forget!</li>
        <li>That's it! I told you it would only take a minute.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If you are like me, and sometimes forget to go to smile.amazon.com when you shop there are some handy browser extensions that will automatically redirect you.
