      <h3>2015 President’s Choice Fundraiser</h3>
      <p>
        The Puget Sound Adjusters Association (PSAA) is an association dedicated
        to provide an arena for interaction and ongoing education for the
        insurance industry. They facilitate monthly educational meetings as well
        as special events for all of the industry to help raise funds for the
        President’s Choice Fundraiser. This year Light My Fire was honored to be
        chosen. With the help of the PSAA we have already raised over $600
        dollars at this year’s Christmas celebration.

      <h3>2015 Silent Auction</h3>
      <p>
        In April, we hosted our 1st Annual Silent Auction at Maplewood Golf
        Course. It was a great first event! We had around 180 in attendance at
        the 3 hour event. There was more than an auction though, as it included
        a sit down dinner and the bag pipes from one of the fire departments.
        For the auction we had over 60 silent auction items and 10 live auction
        items. Included in the auction were 11 custom Fire Fighters’ challenge
        Coins.

      <p>
        This event was dedicated to Lorenzo Silva, the creator of Light My Fire
        of Puget Sound, who unfortunately passed away in 2014. About half of the
        crowd was from the insurance and disaster restoration industry and the
        other half from the public. A very good first turn out.
